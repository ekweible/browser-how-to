                Internet browsers can be extremely useful and helpful tools for doing exactly what the name implies:
                browsing the Internet. This article aims to help you understand the basic features of a browser by
                breaking it up into four parts and describing the functions of each one. With this foundation in place,
                we hope that you will be able to use your browser to easily visit sites and find information.
            </p>

            <p>
                The browser can be broken up into the following components:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#address-bar">Address Bar</a></li>
                <li><a href="#viewport">Viewport</a></li>
                <li><a href="#controls">Controls</a></li>
                <li><a href="#tabs">Tabs</a></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="graphic">
                <img src="images/browser.svg">
            </div>

            <p>
                If you are reading this article in a browser, you may be able to identify these components in a layout
                similar to the one pictured above.
            </p>

            <p>
                The article will conclude with a list of the <a href="#browsers">major Internet browsers</a> that are
                available to you.
            </p>

            <h2 id="address-bar">Address Bar</h2>

            <div class="functions">
                <h3>capabilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visiting a specific site</li>
                    <li>Searching for information</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>address</h4>
                <p>Also known as a URL, this is a unique address that points to a unique location within the Internet.</p>
                <h4>URL</h4>
                <p>URL stands for unique resource locator and is just a fancy word for an Internet address.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Every site or location on the Internet has an <span class="key-term">address</span>, just like houses,
                businesses, or other physical locations. This address is how Internet users are able to navigate to a
                specific site. You have probably seen examples of these addresses (often called
                <span class="key-term">URLs</span>) before:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>google.com</li>
                <li>nytimes.com</li>
                <li>wikipedia.org</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Note: addresses may be written with an </em><strong>http://</strong><em> or </em><strong>www.</strong><em> at the beginning.</em></p>

            <h3>Visiting a specific site</h3>
            <p>
                The first function of the address bar is to visit a specific site or address. If you know the address of
                a site, you can simply type it into the address bar and press "enter" to navigate to that site. The
                content will be displayed in the <a href="#viewport">viewport</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Searching for information</h3>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>search engine</h4>
                <p>
                    A search engine scours the Internet for any information that it can find and provides a tool for
                    searching through that information.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The second function of the address bar is to search for information using a
                <span class="key-term">search engine</span> like Google. This feature is useful for finding information
                or sites when the specific address is not known. By typing a word or a few words into the address bar
                and pressing "enter", a search will be performed using a search engine like Google and the results of
                that search will be displayed in the <a href="#viewport">viewport</a>, just like the content of a
                specific site would be.
            </p>

            <h2 id="viewport">Viewport</h2>

            <div class="functions">
                <h3>Capabilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Displaying content</li>
                    <li>Allowing users to interact with content</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>link</h4>
                <p>
                    A clickable piece of text (usually underlined or colored) that points to an Internet address.
                    Clicking a link is the same as navigating to that address.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The viewport is in a way the simplest component of a browser because it is just a "window" to the
                content. However, this is also the place where the most interaction occurs. Sites will provide content
                for reading and <span class="key-term">links</span> for navigating to other parts of the site or to
                other sites altogether, all of which occurs within this viewport.
            </p>

            <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>

            <div class="functions">
                <h3>Capabilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refreshing</li>
                    <li>Going backward and forward</li>
                    <li>Opening a new tab</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                Every browser has a series of controls available that accomplish a variety of tasks. These controls are
                located around the <a href="#address-bar">address bar</a>, either above, below, or alongside it. While
                there are quite a few controls available, most are beyond the scope of this article.
            </p>

            <h3>Refreshing</h3>
            <p>
                Certain sites like news outlets may update their content frequently. In order to ensure that the latest
                content is being displayed, clicking the "refresh" button will refresh the site content.
            </p>

            <h3>Going backward and forward</h3>
            <p>
                By clicking on links that take you from one location to another, you create a "trail" of sorts that
                starts at the first address visited and ends at the current location. The "back" button will move one
                step backward in this trail while the "forward" button will move you one step forward.
            </p>

            <h3>Opening a new tab</h3>
            <p>
                As discussed in the next section, browsers have the ability to manage multiple locations or windows
                through the usage of <a href="#tabs">tabs</a>. New tabs can be opened by clicking the "+" button located
                near the list of tabs.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tabs">Tabs</h2>
            <p>
                Internet browsers are so useful that users often want to have multiple browsers open at one time. Tabs
                make this simple. The browser displays tabs at or near the top, much like a tabbed file organizer would.
                Each tab has its own <a href="#address-bar">address bar</a>, <a href="#controls">controls</a>, and
                <a href="#viewport">viewport</a>. In other words, each tab is very much like its own Internet browser,
                and the browser as a whole is a collection of these tabs.
            </p>

            <h2 id="browsers">Major Internet Browsers</h2>
            <p>
                A common misconception about browsers is that there is only one way to browse the Internet. Although
                personal computers come with only one Internet browser available from the start (either Internet
                Explorer or Safari), there are actually five major browsers available to everyone (and for free):
            </p>

            <ul class="browsers">
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">FireFox</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari">Safari</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></li>
            </ul>
